---

This is an easy to use BNF tool.
Through regular expressions and BNF,
you can easily convert text to AST in JSON format.

By defining BNF syntax,
you can divide a document into multiple mutually inclusive structures.
Regular expressions can easily make up for the difficulty of defining words in BNF.
Through a simple BNF definition file, you can define the lexer and grammar at the same time.

And, you can use this tool in many ways.
The target text can be converted through the command line;
It can also be integrated into python code to be integrated into your custom programming language project.
